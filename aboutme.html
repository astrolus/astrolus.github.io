                        Hi! I'm a Nigerian-American student from the DFW area and I've spent most of my life here in Texas. I attend school at Texas Tech University
                        in Lubbock, TX and it's been a great experience in how much i've been able to learn and grow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not at my job as a student assistant, I'm usually either playing video games, cruising on my pennyboard, or out trying to get the
                        perfect picture. 
                    </p> 
                    <h3>On Creating This Website:</h3>
                    <p> I started working on this website as a project  part of CS50 to test my skills in web development and put what I've learned into practice. There's much
                        more I still need to do on this website such as making it responsive for mobile devices, designing a better template for the content but for now,
                        this is what I'm currently capable of with Web Design. I plan to also start hosting some of the scripts/tools i write on my github that will be linked
                        on this website.
                    </p>
