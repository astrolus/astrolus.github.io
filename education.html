                        Hi! I'm Joshua Nwankwo and I'm currently a Mechanical Engineering student at Texas Tech. Being in the 2nd semester of
                        my junior year,
                        I'm currently taking:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dynamic Systems and Vibrations</li>
                        <li>Introduction to Design</li>
                        <li>Heat Transfer</li>
                        <li>Linear Algebra</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        So far, the major specific classes I've taken include: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Engineering Mechanics: Statics</li>
                        <li>Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics</li>
                        <li>Materials Science</li>
                        <li>Engineering Thermodynamics I & II</li>
                        <li>Engineering Graphics</li>
                        <li>Fluid Mechanics</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Outside of what my degree plan entails, I'm currently working on improving my programming skills utilizing mainly Python. This website
                    with its content and code was developed using HTML, CSS and some JavaScript and utilizes the Bootstrap 4 framework to aid with styling of the website and 
                    with Google Analytics embedded in all 4 pages to keep track of the total amount of visitors to the site</p>
                <p>
                    I first started off with CS50x, the free online course provided by Harvard University to get an introduction to programming. I've had previous
                    experience in high school with learning Java but I took a 2 year hiatus from programming and decided to try to start off with a course like this for a fresh 
                    start. I completed each of the weeks and finally took up the web track. Originally my goal was to build a website and I decided that following
                    this course would give me a good background to make that happen.
                </p>
