                        One of the biggest flaws I've been able to improve upon would be my communication skills and its something that each of my work experiences
                        have helped me develop further. I was able to learn to speak more confidently with knowledge backing it and also being more concise
                        in all forms of communication. <i> If you would prefer a PDF copy of my resume, feel free to reach out via email and I can send a copy immediately</i>
